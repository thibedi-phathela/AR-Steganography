# What is AR_Steganography

The AR_Steganography Application is an Augmented Reality Steganography App that uses **select markers** to uncover *hidden* video files behind randomly selected images.


## AR_Steganography Description

1. What This App Does:
The application uses a devices camera to scan it's surroundings as if it is just a regular camera. Once the camera comes across a certain image that it was *programmed* to identify as a key, it then reveals a hidden video which will play over the image key. AR_Steganography was built specifically for Android users using [Unity](https://unity.com/).

2. Why We Used Unity:
Unity allows you to build real-time 3-D and 2-D experiences for **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**, as well as for **Desktop, Web and other Mobile Devices** in the form of games, interactive simulations, etc. The platform provides developers with the Mixed and Augmented Reality Studio (MARS), which simplifies the development of AR applications. It also supports cross-platform integration with platforms such as *Vuforia, Steam VR, Google's ARCore, etc* which allows developers to experience the benefits of multiple platforms in a convenient and user-friendly way.

3. Challenges Faced and Future Feataures


### How to Install and Use AR_Steganograpy:

1. Step 1:
Visit the Respository in [GitHub](https://github.com/thibedi-phathela/AR-Steganography) created by one of the group members. Here you will find a host of files including the AR_Steganography APK, the marker assets as well as a How-To video demonstrating the process of installation and ustilisation of this application.

2. Step 2:
Open the APK file, and select *View Raw*. This will download the APK file and automatically store it onto your device.

3. Step 3:
If you wish to use this application on any device other than an Android, you will need to download an Android emulator such as [Memu](https://www.memuplay.com/), which this app has already been tested on. 
  Emulator
  : Open up the emulator, import the APK file from your downloads, and installation should begin automatically.

  Android Device
  : Open the downloaded file, and installation should begin automatically.

4. Step 4:
Now, whether or not you are using an Android device, the application should work the same once it has been installed on your device/emulator.
When you open the app, a *Start* button should appear on the screen. Click on the button, and a camera block will be generated.

5. Step 5:
If you let the camera hover over anything in your surroundings, it will just look like a normal device camera. Open the marker images that have been provided in the GitHub Repository and hover the camera block over the images individually. Marker-00 should uncover a hidden video of an explosion once the camera identifies the image. Marker01 should produce a hidden video of an elephant crying over a few books.
